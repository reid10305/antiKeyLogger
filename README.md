# antiKeyLogger
just a stupid little thing

Used to type a text file to over the USB interface to type really fast. 
The Arduino used has to be based on the 32u4 architecture. Any text file 
can be loaded into the SD card, and selected using the select button. 
To type, the type button should be held down.
